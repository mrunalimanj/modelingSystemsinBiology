# Modeling systems in biology with computational tools.

A suite of explorations of biological systems... for the QBio REU program. (a work in progress!)

Different (populations of) systems to explore:
* Molecules...
  * atoms (learning molecular substructures with machine learning?)
  * DNA systems? 
  * RNA
* Cells... 
  * scRNA data
  * Cell systems?
* Tissues... 
  * Brain activity
  * Expression, Immune activity...
* Organs...
  * ?
* and Populations
  * Phylogenetics / virus spread! Not trying to make armchair epidemiologists out of anyone, but making interesting simulations of spread would be intriguing.
