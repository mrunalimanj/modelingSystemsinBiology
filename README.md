# Modeling systems in biology with computational tools.

A suite of explorations of biological systems... maybe for own exploration, maybe for the QBio REU program. (a work in progress!)

Different (populations of) systems to explore:
### Molecules
  1. atoms (learning molecular substructures, e.g. SMILES with natural language models?)
  2. DNA: origami structures (Shawn Douglas' work)  
  Proteins:
  3. structural biology/PyRosetta for antibody design/exploration
  5. Synthetic biology (TBD)
### Cells
  6. scRNA data
  7. Stem cell fate engineering
### Tissues:
  8. Neuron activity, circuits, neuroscience
  9. Imaging of some kind + processing?
### Organs + Human Populations
  10. Epidemiology (how are respiratory droplets spread? fluid dynamics)
  11. Mental health (how did it fare during the pandemic?)
